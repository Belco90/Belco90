## About me

Working as a Web Engineer since 2013. I have a degree and a diploma in Computer Sciences, but when it comes to the web platform and cloud services, I've learned it all on my own. Author of [`eslint-plugin-testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library) and [`octochangelog`](https://octochangelog.com/).
